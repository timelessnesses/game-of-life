# Conway's Game Of Life in Rust

A SDL2 game that simulates Conway's Game of Life. With under 200 (Commit: [379bfc5](https://github.com/timelessnesses/game-of-life/commit/379bfc5faaba5d8fdf0669457e57c5eaa40be97b)) lines of code from a Rust noob!

## Building

Install `cargo-vcpkg` and do `cargo vcpkg -v build` then `cargo build -r` to build binary with bundled extension.

## How long did this took

3 hours actually.
